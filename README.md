# ECS404U MIPS Coursework

This assembly code was used as a check to see if it would produce the results expected.  
This means it requires the testing program to be able to see this work.

## Explanation
A set of numbers stored on the heap on the test code are passed through two algorithms in the `coursework.asm` file.  
The results go through another final algorithm which then are stored on the stack.  
These results were then compared with the expected results.


### Specifications
In order to run this, you will need the [MIPS32 Simulator](https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)
